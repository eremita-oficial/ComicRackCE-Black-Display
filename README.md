This project is a fork of the ComicRack Community Edition (originally `maforget/ComicRackCE`), which in turn aims to revive the legendary Comic Manager, ComicRack, untouched for 10 years.
The ComicRack Community Edition is the decompiled version of the original application, released to the community.

### ðŸŒ™ ComicRack CE - Black Display Edition

This version focuses on providing **enhanced visual comfort** for reading. The primary modification implemented is the **change of the comic display window's background to black**. This alteration aims to reduce eye strain, especially in low-light environments or during extended reading sessions.

### Key Features: 
 - Comic display background changed to black.
 - Reduced eye strain.
 - All original ComicRackCE functionalities preserved.

Further usability improvements and adjustments may be considered in the future, but the primary focus of this edition is visual comfort.

### Upgrading from Classic ComicRack

ComicRackCE [Black Display Edition] uses a different data directory than classic ComicRack. To transfer your data:

1.  Run ComicRack from the link on your Desktop or Start Menu.
2.  Once ComicRack has loaded, close it again (check the system tray); this creates the required folders.
3.  Open Windows Explorer.
4.  Copy and paste `%appdata%\cYo\ComicRack` into the address bar and press enter. You'll see your existing ComicRack data. Consider making a backup of this directory just in case.
5.  Copy all the contents of this directory.
6.  Navigate one directory up and open the `ComicRack [Black Display Edition]` directory.
7.  Paste your data into this directory and overwrite any existing files.
8.  Open ComicRack [Black Display Edition], and all your comics/scripts should be there.

Remember that changes in one will not carry over to the other.

> [!NOTE]
> You might want to update the background & paper texture settings in Book Display Settings (and in any saved Workspaces). Since the path of the textures is hardcoded, they will still refer to the original ComicRack install location.
